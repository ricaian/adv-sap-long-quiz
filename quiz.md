## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture

1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
-Service-oriented architecture, or SOA. It provides an interface-based method for reusing software components. Applications that utilize services offered by the network are referred to as SOAs in architectural terminology. Through an internet-based network call, services this are made available to apps in this design. It speeds up and simplifies service connections in applications by utilizing common communication standards. In SOA, every service is an independently full-featured business operation.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-The characteristics of SOA are that this can separate the complexity this can make integration manageable. Also SOA can easily to fin or discoverability this can find the store metadata in a service registry or a profile fast.

3. Define Microservices.
 -The term "microservices," or "microservice architecture," refers to a software development technique that divides programs into separate parts with unique features and clear interfaces.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-The benefits of using microservices are that first, microservices are advantage for engineers because microservices are architectural model that are better facilitates in an operational model. Also microservices is in charge of a particular activity, microservices provide greater data security and compliance and make it simpler to deploy security measures at the service level. And lastly microservices design allows for the flexibility of employing the appropriate tools for each project's requirements because each microservices can be executed on any platform and developed in any language. This will benefit in terms of both speed and employee morale.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-The similarities and difference of SOA and microservices are that they are both relying on services as their main component but they are different in terms of service characteristics.

6. Define Web Services.
-Is a software that supports that can be accessed thorough internet by people.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
-web services provide service to the user who are wanted to search something through online. Web services also provide interoperability or meaning that the user can talk to each other even when they are far away.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
-the characteristics of a web services is first the XML that provides data transportation. And by using XML this eliminates any networking. And also, this can have the ability to synchronous or asynchronous by binding the client.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
-the distinct roles of a web services architecture are to provide to available through the client applications. And also, this can be a requestor that needs to call or contact a web services. This can be any type of language either java or .net. 

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
-	The web services components are XML and JAVA EE this services use to help the user to create a web services and also this can be declare methods to be accessed by other applications.
